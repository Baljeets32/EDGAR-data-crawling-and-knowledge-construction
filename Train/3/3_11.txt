Our ability to use net operating losses and certain other tax attributes is uncertain and may be limited. Our ability to use our federal and state net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the net operating losses; and we cannot predict with certainty when; or whether; we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our net operating losses. In addition; utilization of net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is subject to annual limitations under the ownership change provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; as amended (Internal Revenue Code) and similar state provisions; which may result in the expiration of net operating losses before future utilization. In general; under the Code; if a corporation undergoes an ownership change; generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period; the corporation s ability to use its pre change net operating losses and other pre change tax attributes (such as research and development credit carryforwards) to offset its post change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Our equity offerings and other changes in our stock ownership; some of which are outside of our control; may have resulted or could in the future result in an ownership change. Although we have completed studies to provide reasonable assurance that an ownership change limitation would not apply; we cannot be certain that a taxing authority would reach the same conclusion. If; after a review or audit; an ownership change limitation were to apply; utilization of our domestic net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods and a portion of the carryforwards could expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities.
