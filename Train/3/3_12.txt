Our product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance. Arhalofenate has been studied in a total of 17 clinical trials with over 1;100 subjects. The emergence of adverse events (AEs) caused by arhalofenate in future studies could cause us; other reviewing entities; clinical study sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt; delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. There is also a risk that our other product candidates; including MBX 8025; may induce AEs; many of which may be unknown at this time. If an unacceptable frequency and or severity of AEs are reported in our clinical trials for our product candidates; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for product candidates; including arhalofenate and MBX 8025; may be negatively impacted. Furthermore; if any of our approved products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval; a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result; including the following regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in a form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements; such as warnings or contraindications that could diminish the usage of the product or otherwise limit the commercial success of the affected product we may be required to change the way the product is administered or to conduct additional clinical studies we may choose to discontinue sale of the product we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and our reputation may suffer. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.
