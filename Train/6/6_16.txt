If product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us; we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products. The testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims; we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. We carry product liability insurance that is limited in scope and amount and may not be adequate to fully protect us against product liability claims. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop; alone or with corporate collaborators. We; or our corporate collaborators; might not be able to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost; if at all. While under various circumstances we are entitled to be indemnified against losses by our corporate collaborators; indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise.
