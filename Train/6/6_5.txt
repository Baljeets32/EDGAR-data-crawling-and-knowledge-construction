Even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval; we and our collaborators will be subject to ongoing government regulation. Even if regulatory authorities approve any of our drug candidates; the manufacture; marketing and sale of these drugs will be subject to strict and ongoing regulation. Compliance with such regulations may consume substantial financial and management resources and expose us and our collaborators to the potential for other adverse circumstances. For example; a regulatory authority can place restrictions on the sale or marketing of a drug in order to manage the risks identified during initial clinical trials or after the drug is on the market. A regulatory authority can condition the approval for a drug on costly post marketing follow up studies. Based on these studies; if a regulatory authority does not believe that the drug demonstrates a clinical benefit to patients or an acceptable safety profile; it could limit the indications for which a drug may be sold or revoke the drug s marketing approval. In addition; identification of certain side effects either during clinical trials or after a drug is on the market may result in reformulation of a drug; additional preclinical and clinical trials; labeling changes; termination of ongoing clinical trials or withdrawal of approval. Any of these events could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the commercialization of these drugs and cause us to incur significant additional costs.
