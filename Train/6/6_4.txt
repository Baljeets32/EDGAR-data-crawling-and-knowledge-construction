Delays in clinical trials are common and have many causes; and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales. Clinical testing is expensive; difficult to design and implement; can take many years to complete; and is uncertain as to outcome. We may experience delays in clinical trials at any stage of development and testing of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time; have an effective design; enroll a sufficient number of subjects; or be completed on schedule; if at all. Events which may result in delays or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials; including our future clinical trials for MBX 8025 and arhalofenate; include the following inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial delays in reaching agreement with the FDA or other regulatory authorities on final trial design imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites delays in obtaining required institutional review board (IRB) approval at each site delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial delays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post treatment follow up delays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise delays caused by clinical sites dropping out of a trial time required to add new clinical sites and delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials. If initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials for our product candidates; including MBX 8025 and arhalofenate; is delayed for any of the above reasons; our development costs may increase; the approval process 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements could be delayed; any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates may be reduced and our competitors may bring products to market before us. Any of these events could impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales and impair our ability to generate regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties; all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
