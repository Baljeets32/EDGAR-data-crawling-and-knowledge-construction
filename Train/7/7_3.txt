Our future success depends on our ability to effectively recruit and retain our senior management and other key employees and attract; retain and motivate qualified personnel. We depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management; our research and development staff and a number of other key management; sales; support; technical and administrative services personnel. In particular; we rely on the experience of our senior management; who have specific knowledge of our business and industry that is difficult to replace. If we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified senior management; our business may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Competition for experienced; high quality personnel exists; particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area; and we cannot assure you that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel. Our failure to hire; train and retain qualified personnel would impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively.
