The requirements of being a public company have required and will continue to require significant resources; increase our costs and occupy our management; and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost effective manner. As a company with public reporting responsibilities; we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal; accounting; and other expenses related to; among other things preparing; filing and distributing periodic and current reports under the Exchange Act for a larger operating business and complying with other Exchange Act requirements applicable to public companies maintaining and updating internal policies; such as those relating to insider trading and disclosure controls and procedures involving and retaining to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities and establishing and maintaining an investor relations function; including the provision of certain information on our website. If we are successful in our efforts to uplist to a national securities exchange or if we cease to be a smaller reporting company under applicable SEC regulations; we will also be subject to additional reporting and compliance requirements. Compliance with these rules and regulations has and will cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs. In addition; we are required to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure. In particular; we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with these requirements. Moreover; if we are not able to comply with these requirements in a timely manner; or if we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses; the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities; which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources.
