Securities class action lawsuits or other litigation could result in substantial damages and may divert management s time and attention from our business. We have been subject to class action lawsuits in the past; including a securities class action lawsuit commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in February 2009; that was ultimately dismissed in November 2012. However; we may be subject to similar or completely unrelated claims in the future; such as those that might occur if there was to be a change in our corporate strategy. These and other lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties; and the actual costs to be incurred relating to the lawsuit will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of litigation is necessarily uncertain; and we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of such suits; and we may not prevail. Monitoring and defending against legal actions is time consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. In addition; we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with any such litigation. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to any such potential lawsuits. It is possible that we could; in the future; incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on any such actions could result in the payment of substantial damages; or possibly fines; and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow; results of operations and financial position.
