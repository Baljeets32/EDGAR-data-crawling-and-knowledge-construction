We are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012; or the JOBS Act; emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We are availing ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and; therefore; we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company; we also intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including; but not limited to; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved; exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). If we do; the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our status as an emerging growth company; there may be less liquidity for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter; (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year; (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non convertible debt in a three year period or (iv) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act (a date which occurred in July 2014).
