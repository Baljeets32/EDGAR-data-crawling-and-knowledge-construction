We are not currently listed on a national exchange and there can be no assurance we will ever be listed. As a result of our failure to make timely filings of financial statements; we were delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market in 2004. Currently; our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol DDXS. We do not know when; if ever; our common stock will be listed on a national stock exchange. In order to be eligible for relisting or listing; we must meet the initial listing criteria for The NASDAQ Stock Market or another national exchange; including a minimum per share price. We currently do not meet these requirements and cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy these requirements; or if we satisfy them; that we will be able to maintain compliance with them.
