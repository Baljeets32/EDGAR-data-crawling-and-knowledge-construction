If a dispute arises regarding the infringement or misappropriation of the proprietary rights of others; such dispute could be costly and result in delays in our research and development activities and partnering. Our success will depend; in part; on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. There are many issued patents and patent applications filed by third parties relating to products or processes that are similar or identical to our licensors or ours; and others may be filed in the future. There may also be copyrights or trademarks that third parties hold. There can be no assurance that our activities; or those of our licensors; will not violate intellectual property rights of others. We believe that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights; and we do not know if our collaborators or we would be successful in any such litigation. Any legal action against our collaborators or us claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products; our methods or processes could require our collaborators or us to obtain a license to continue to use; manufacture or market the affected products; methods or processes; which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms; if at all prevent us from using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others subject us to potential liability for damages consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources and result in litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly; whether we win or lose.
