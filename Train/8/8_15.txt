We license key intellectual property from GlaxoSmithKline and ICOS; and our contractual relationships have certain limitations. We have an exclusive license from GlaxoSmithKline (formerly SmithKlineBeecham plc) and a co exclusive license from ICOS Corporation ( ICOS ); subsequently acquired by Eli Lilly and Company; to practice and commercialize technology covered by several issued and pending U.S. patents and their foreign counterparts. Some of these licensed patents covering composition of matter and cardiovascular diagnostic claims have different expiration dates from 2015 through 2016; which may limit our ability to generate future revenue from products claimed under those exclusive and co exclusive licenses. Several of our agreements with each of GlaxoSmithKline and ICOS provide licenses to use intellectual property that is important to our business; and we may enter into additional agreements in the future with GlaxoSmithKline or with other third parties that change licenses to valuable technology. Current licenses impose; and future licenses may impose; various commercialization; milestones and other obligations on us; including the obligation to terminate our use of patented subject matter under certain circumstances. If a licensor becomes entitled to; and exercises; termination rights under a license; we could lose valuable rights and our ability to develop our current and future products. Our business may suffer if any current or future licenses terminate; if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license or fail to prevent infringement by third parties; if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms.
