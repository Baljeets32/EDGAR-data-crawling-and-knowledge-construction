We license certain key intellectual property from third parties; and the loss of our license rights could have a materially adverse effect on our business. We are a party to a number of technology licenses that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. For example; we rely on an exclusive license to certain patents; proprietary technology and know how from DiaTex; which include arhalofenate. During the term of the exclusive license with DiaTex we may perform research and development of compounds and products for the treatment of human disease based on the patents; proprietary technology and know how from DiaTex. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our agreement with DiaTex; including our obligations to pay royalty payments during the development and commercialization of arhalofenate; or our other license agreements; or if we are subject to a bankruptcy; the licensor may have the right to terminate the license; in which event we would not be able to develop or market products covered by the license; including in the case of the DiaTex license; arhalofenate; which would have a materially adverse effect on our business.
