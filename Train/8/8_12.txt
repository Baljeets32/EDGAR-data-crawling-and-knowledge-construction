The drug research and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation; and we may be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits. The drug research and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation; and we believe these lawsuits are likely to continue. Legal proceedings relating to intellectual property would be expensive; take significant time and divert management s attention from other business concerns. We face potential patent infringement suits by companies that control patents for drugs or potential drugs similar to our product candidates or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. There could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products and their use; whether as single agents or in combination with other products; infringe or patents that we believe we do not infringe that we are ultimately found to infringe. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. Because patent applications can take many years to issue; there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that we infringe with our drug candidates or resulting products; and their use as single agents or in combination with other products. In addition; technology created under our research and development collaborations may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties; in which case we may not receive milestone or royalty revenue from those collaborations. If we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us; we might have to pay substantial damages and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use the patented technology or redesign our products so as not to infringe the patent. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements at a reasonable cost or effectively redesign our products. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could delay the introduction of our products or prevent us from manufacturing or selling products.
