Agreements we have with our employees; consultants and collaborators may not afford adequate protection for our trade secrets; confidential information and other proprietary information. In addition to patent protection; we also rely on copyright and trademark protection; trade secrets; and know how. It is unclear whether our trade secrets and know how will prove to be adequately protected. To protect our trade secrets and know how; we require our employees; consultants and advisors to execute agreements regarding the confidentiality and ownership of such proprietary information. We cannot guarantee; however; that these agreements will provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information and there may not be adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Our employees; consultants or advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition; in some situations; these agreements may conflict with; or be subject to; the rights of third parties with whom our employees; consultants or advisors had or have previous employment or consulting relationships. Like patent litigation; enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition; courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing than our federal and state courts to protect trade secrets. Furthermore; others may independently develop substantially equivalent knowledge; methods and know how. Our failure or inability to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to compete effectively or exclude certain competitors from the market. 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS
