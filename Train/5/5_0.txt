Our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones; and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment; which could require us to cease or curtail operations. Our facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters; including fires; floods; power loss; communications failures and similar events. If any disaster were to occur; our ability to operate our business at our facilities would be seriously; or potentially completely; impaired; and our research could be lost or destroyed. In addition; the unique nature of our research activities and of much of our equipment could make it difficult for us to recover from a disaster. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.
