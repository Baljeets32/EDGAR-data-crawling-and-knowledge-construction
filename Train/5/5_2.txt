To the extent that we create any joint ventures or have any variable interest entities for which we are required to consolidate; we would need to rely on those entities to timely deliver important financial information to us. In the event that the financial information is inaccurate; incomplete; or not timely; we would not be able to meet our financial reporting obligations as required by the SEC. While we currently do not have any joint ventures or variable interest entities that we are required to consolidate; to the extent we create such joint ventures or variable interest entities for which we would be required to consolidate and the financial statements of such entities are not prepared by us; we will not have direct control over their financial statement preparation. As a result; we will; for our financial reporting; depend on what these entities report to us; which could result in us adding monitoring and audit processes; which could increase the difficulty of implementing and maintaining adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. This may be particularly true when such entities do not have sophisticated financial accounting processes in place; or where we are entering into new relationships at a rapid pace; straining our integration capacity. Additionally; if we do not receive the information from the joint venture or variable interest entity on a timely basis; this could cause delays in our external reporting obligations as required by the SEC.
