Even if we or our collaborators bring products to market; we may be unable to price our products effectively or obtain adequate reimbursement for sales of our products; which would have an adverse effect on our revenues. The requirements governing product licensing; pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries; the pricing review period begins after product licensing approval is granted. As a result; we may obtain regulatory approval for a drug candidate in a particular country; but then be subject to price regulations that reduce our profits from the sale of the product. In some foreign markets pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to continuing government control even after initial marketing approval. Varying price regulation between countries can lead to inconsistent prices and some re selling by third parties of products from markets where products are sold at lower prices to markets where those products are sold at higher prices. Any practice of exploiting price differences between countries could undermine our sales in markets with higher prices and reduce the sales of our future products; if any. 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS Additionally; third party payors; such as government and private insurance plans; frequently require companies to provide rebates and predetermined discounts from list prices and are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceuticals and other medical products. Our products may not be considered cost effective; and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or be sufficient to allow the sale of our products on a competitive basis. We; or our collaborators; may not be able to negotiate favorable reimbursement rates for our products. If we; or our collaborators; fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products by third party payors; sales of the drugs would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable market for the products.
