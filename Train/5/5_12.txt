If conflicts arise between our collaborators or advisors and us; any of them may act in their self interest; which may be adverse to our stockholders interests. If conflicts arise between us and our corporate collaborators or scientific advisors; the other party may act in its self interest and not in the interest of our stockholders. Some of our corporate collaborators are conducting multiple product development efforts within each disease area that is the subject of the collaboration with us or may be acquired or merged with a company having a competing program. In some of our collaborations; we have agreed not to conduct; independently or with any third party; any research that is competitive with the research conducted under our collaborations. Our collaborators; however; may develop; either alone or with others; products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of these collaborations. Competing products; either developed by our collaborators or to which our collaborators have rights; may result in their withdrawal of support for our product candidates. If any of our corporate collaborators were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct the collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner; the preclinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidates or research programs could be delayed or terminated. We generally do not control the amount and timing of resources that our corporate collaborators devote to our programs or potential products. We do not know whether current or future collaborative partners; if any; might pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others; including our competitors; as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by collaborative arrangements with us.
