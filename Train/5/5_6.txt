Failure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business. Our ability to execute our business plan depends; in part; on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology ( IT ) systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources; including telecommunications or network failures; malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover; despite network security and back up measures; some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins; computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems; sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
