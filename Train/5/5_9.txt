Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock; including pursuant to our equity incentive plans; could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. We expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities; our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock; convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. For example; in July 2015; we completed the issuance of 8;188;000 shares of our common stock at $2.81 per share in an underwritten public offering for net proceeds to us of $21.1 million; and in November 2014 we filed a $100 million registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC and also entered into an ATM to sell up to $25 million of common stock under the registration statement under which we have sold additional shares of our common stock for net proceeds to us of $4.3 million during the period January 1; 2015; through December 31; 2015. If in the future; we sell common stock; convertible securities or other equity securities; investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in new investors gaining rights superior to our existing stockholders. Pursuant to our equity incentive plans; our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity based awards to our employees; directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under our equity incentive plans as of March 1; 2016; was 890;050 shares.
