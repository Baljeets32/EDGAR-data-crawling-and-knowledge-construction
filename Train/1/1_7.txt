If our competitors develop and market products that are more effective; safer or less expensive than our own; our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted. The life sciences industry is highly competitive; and we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical; biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and possibly from academic institutions; government agencies and private and public research institutions that are researching; developing and marketing products designed to address the treatment of gout. Our competitors may have significantly greater financial; manufacturing; marketing and drug development resources. Large pharmaceutical companies; in particular; have extensive experience in the clinical testing of; obtaining regulatory approvals for; and marketing of; drugs. New developments; including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease; occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us; potential competitors may have substantially greater research and development resources; including personnel and technology regulatory experience experience in pharmaceutical development and commercialization ability to negotiate competitive pricing and reimbursement with third party payors experience and expertise in exploitation of intellectual property rights and capital resources. As a result of these factors; our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. The competitors may also develop products that are more effective; better tolerated; more useful and less costly than our products and they may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products.
