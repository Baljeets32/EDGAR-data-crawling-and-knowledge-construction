Even if we receive regulatory approval for arhalofenate or MBX 8025; we will be subject to ongoing FDA and other regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review; which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize arhalofenate or MBX 8025. Any regulatory approvals that we or potential collaboration partners receive for arhalofenate; MBX 8025 or future product candidates; may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing studies. In addition; even if approved; the labeling; packaging; adverse event reporting; storage; advertising; promotion and recordkeeping for any product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product; including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency; may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product; and could include withdrawal of the product from the market. Depending on any safety issues associated with our product candidates that are approved; the FDA may require a REMS; thereby imposing certain restrictions on the sale and marketability of such products or additional post marketing requirements. Regulatory policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood; nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action; either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance; we might not be permitted to market arhalofenate or future products; if any; and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.
