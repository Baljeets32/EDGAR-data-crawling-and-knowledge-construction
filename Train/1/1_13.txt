Manufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization of our products. We are increasing the manufacturing batch sizes of our products in preparation of late stage clinical development and commercial supplies. As the processes are scaled up they may reveal manufacturing challenges or previously unknown impurities which could require resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for the commercial marketing of our products. In the future; we may identify manufacturing issues or impurities which could result in delays in the clinical program and regulatory approval for our products; increases in our operating expenses; or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products. Our reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks; including the following the inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently a delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale up of manufacturing costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale up a failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us the reliance on a limited number of sources; and in some cases; single sources for key materials; such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these key materials; we will be unable to manufacture and sell our product candidates in a timely fashion; in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms the lack of qualified backup suppliers for those materials that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements operations of our third party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations; including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control and the failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner. Any of these events could lead to clinical study delays; failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA or other regulatory authorities action; including injunction; recall; seizure; or total or partial suspension of production.
