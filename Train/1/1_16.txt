Our current debt financing contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business; and our lender may accelerate repayment of amounts outstanding under certain circumstances. In September 2014; we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford (the Loan and Security Agreement ). The Loan and Security Agreement contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants. These covenants limit our ability to; among other things Dispose of property Merge; consolidate or acquire another entity Incur additional indebtedness Enter into transactions with affiliates and Pay dividends or make other distributions or payments on our capital stock. If we breach any of these covenants; are unable to make a required payment of principal or interest; or experience a material adverse change to our business; it could result in an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement; Oxford could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay the amounts due under the Loan and Security Agreement; Oxford could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets; other than our intellectual property; as collateral under the loan. Any event of default under the Loan and Security Agreement could significantly jeopardize our business and ability to continue as a going concern.
