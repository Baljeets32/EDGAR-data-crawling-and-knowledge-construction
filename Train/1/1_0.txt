After the completion of our clinical trials; we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates and we cannot; therefore; predict the timing of any future revenue from our product candidates. Regulatory approval of an NDA is not guaranteed; and the approval process is expensive; uncertain and lengthy. We cannot commercialize our product candidates; including arhalofenate and MBX 8025; until the appropriate regulatory authorities; such as the FDA; have reviewed and approved the product candidate. The regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner; or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. Additional delays may result if a product candidate is brought before an FDA advisory committee; which could recommend restrictions on approval or recommend non approval of the product candidate. In addition; we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action; or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development; clinical studies and the review process. As a result; we cannot predict when; if at all; we will receive any future revenue from commercialization of any of our product candidates; including arhalofenate and MBX 8025. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process; including the ability to delay; limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons; including the following we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication regulatory authorities may not find the data from nonclinical studies and clinical studies sufficient or may differ in the interpretation of the data regulatory authorities may require additional nonclinical or clinical studies the FDA or foreign regulatory authority might not approve our third party manufacturers processes or facilities for clinical or commercial product the FDA or foreign regulatory authority may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical studies 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the FDA or foreign regulatory authority may not accept clinical data from studies that are conducted in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that in the U.S. the results of clinical studies may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for approval we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks and the data collection from clinical studies of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere. In addition; events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased caution by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety; efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals.
