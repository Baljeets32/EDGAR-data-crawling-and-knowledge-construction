If any product candidate that we successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians; patients; health care payors and the medical community; the revenues that it generates from its sales will be limited. Even if arhalofenate; MBX 8025 or any other product candidates receive regulatory approval; the products may not gain market acceptance among physicians; patients; health care payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third party payors; including government payors; generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products will depend upon a number of factors; including the efficacy and safety; as demonstrated in clinical studies the risk benefit profile of our product candidates such as arhalofenate the prevalence and severity of any side effects the clinical indications for which the product is approved acceptance of the product by physicians; other health care providers and patients as a safe and effective treatment the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group; including if physicians prescribe our products for uses outside the approved indications the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments the timing of market introduction of competitive products the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities relative convenience and ease of administration and the effectiveness of our or our partners sales; marketing and distribution efforts. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians; hospitals; health care payors and patients; we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and we may not become or remain profitable. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
