Delays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates. Clinical trials typically take several years to complete. The duration and cost of clinical trials will vary greatly depending on the nature; complexity; and intended use of the drug being tested. Even if the results of our clinical trials are favorable; the clinical trials of tivantinib and other product candidates will continue for several years and may take significantly longer than expected to complete. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing for tivantinib or pre clinical or clinical testing for any of our other product candidates could significantly affect our product development costs and business plan. We have experienced a number of clinical trial related delays and obstacles related to tivantinib. These delays and obstacles include results of the MARQUEE trial in non squamous NSCLC; which did not meet its primary endpoint results of the ATTENTION trial in non squamous NSCLC; which did not meet its primary endpoint results of the Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer; which did not meet its primary endpoint results of the Phase 2 trial in KRAS mutant NSCLC; which did not meet its primary endpoint results of NIH sponsored clinical trials the side effect of ILD observed in the ATTENTION trial and the side effect of neutropenia observed in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 METIV HCC trials in HCC; leading to the lowering of the doses in both of these trials. We cannot predict if the data from these trials will lead to further testing or approval of tivantinib as either a single agent or part of combination therapies in these indications. At any time; a clinical trial can be placed on clinical hold or temporarily or permanently stopped for a variety of reasons; principally for safety concerns. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during; or as a result of; the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates; including the following our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results; and we may decide; or regulators may require us; to provide additional information about formulation or manufacture of our product candidates or clinical trial design or to conduct additional clinical and or pre clinical testing or to abandon programs 22 TABLE OF CONTENTS we may experience delays related to reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations; or CROs; clinical investigators and trial sites; the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs; clinical investigators and trial sites we may be unable to source suitable diagnostic tests for our trials in targeted patient populations we may be unable to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials trial results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies enrollment in our clinical trials for our product candidates may be slower than we anticipate; resulting in significant delays we; or regulators; may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks the effects of our product candidates on patients may not be the desired therapeutic effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that may delay or preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use; if approved and the FDA or other regulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of our drugs; which could lengthen the regulatory review process. Completion and duration of clinical trials depends on; among other things; our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients; which is a function of many factors; including the incidence among the general population of diseases which contain therapeutic endpoints chosen for evaluation the eligibility criteria defined in the protocol the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial s therapeutic endpoints our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators and sites with the appropriate competencies and experience our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents and competition for patients by clinical trial programs for other treatments. We reached Special Protocol Assessment ( SPA ) agreements with the FDA for the design of the ongoing Phase 3 METIV trial of tivantinib in patients with second line HCC and for the Phase 3 MARQUEE trial; which was discontinued following an interim analysis. The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a New Drug Application. Final marketing approval depends on the results of the trial. The SPA may not be sufficient for the purpose of obtaining marketing approval for tivantinib. Clinical trials may also be delayed or repeated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or unforeseen complications in testing. In addition; a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us; the FDA; the institutional review board ( IRB ) overseeing the clinical trial at issue; any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site; or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors; including failure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols failure by us; our employees; our CROs or their employees to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with all applicable FDA; Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) or other regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold 23 TABLE OF CONTENTS discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by study participants or other unforeseen safety issues lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial; including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays; requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties lack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials failure of our CROs or other third party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols and unfavorable results from on going clinical trials and pre clinical studies. Additionally; changes in applicable regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination; which may impact the costs; timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of; or if we terminate; any of our clinical trials; the commercial prospects for tivantinib and our other product candidates may be harmed; which may have a material adverse effect on our business; results of operations; financial condition and prospects.
