Even if we obtain FDA approval for arhalofenate; MBX 8025 or any of our other product candidates in the U.S.; we may never obtain approval for or commercialize arhalofenate; MBX 8025 or any of our other product candidates outside of the U.S.; which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. In order to market any products outside of the U.S.; we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country by country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. In addition; clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries; and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction; including international markets; and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals; or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed; our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be unrealized.
