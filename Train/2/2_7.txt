Failure to successfully validate; develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics could harm our drug development strategy. One of the key elements of our clinical development strategy is to seek to identify patient subsets within a disease category that may derive particular benefit from the product candidates we are developing. In collaboration with our partners and third party developers; we plan to develop companion diagnostics to help us to identify patients within a particular subset; both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates. For example; we are using diagnostic tests to identify 27 TABLE OF CONTENTS MET high patients for the METIV HCC and the JET HCC trials. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We do not develop companion diagnostics internally and thus we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of third party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. We; our partners and our companion diagnostic collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for companion diagnostics; including issues relating to selectivity specificity; analytical validation; reproducibility; or clinical validation. Any delay or failure by our collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates. In addition; our collaborators may encounter production difficulties or difficulties sourcing key materials that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostics; and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostics in the clinical community. If such companion diagnostics fail to gain market acceptance; it would have an adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from sales of our products. In addition; the diagnostic companies with whom we and our partners work may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the companion diagnostic that we anticipate using in connection with development and commercialization of our product candidates; or our relationship with such diagnostic companies may otherwise terminate according to the terms of our agreements with them. We may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms; which could adversely affect and or delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates. In addition; many current companion diagnostic products; including those used in the METIV HCC trial; use immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) to identify patients within a target group. The results of IHC tests are determined by pathologists and clinicians and therefore are subject to variation from reader to reader. While efforts are made to ensure rigorous training; such inherent variability can impact patient selection and cause variation from lab to lab and trial to trial.
