If our drug discovery and development programs do not progress as anticipated; our revenue and stock price could be negatively impacted. We estimate the timing of a variety of preclinical; clinical; regulatory and other milestones for planning purposes; including when a drug candidate is expected to enter clinical trials; how soon patients will be recruited and enrolled in these trials; when a clinical trial will be completed and when an application for regulatory approval will be filed. We base our estimates on facts that are currently known to us and on a variety of assumptions; many of which are beyond our control. If we or our collaborators do not achieve milestones when anticipated our revenues and stock price could decline. In addition; our research and clinical testing may be delayed or abandoned if we or our competitors subsequently discover other compounds that show improved safety or efficacy compared to our product candidates; which could limit our ability to generate revenues; cause us to incur additional expense and cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.
