Our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing upon or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. There are many patents in our field of technology and we cannot guarantee that we do not infringe on those patents or that we will not infringe on patents granted in the future. If a patent holder believes a product of ours infringes on its patent; the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology. If we do not prevail in litigation or if other parties have filed; or in the future should file; patent applications covering products and technologies that we have developed or intend to develop; we may have to obtain licenses from third parties; which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms; or at all; and may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant a cross license to some of our patents to another patent holder. Additionally; we may have to change the formulation of a product candidate so that we do not infringe third party patents. Such reformulation may be impossible to achieve or which may require substantial time and expense. If we are unable to cost effectively redesign our products so they do not infringe a patent; we may be unable to sell some of our products. Any of these occurrences will result in lost revenues and profits for us.
