We face potential liability related to the privacy of health information we obtain from research institutions. Most health care providers; including research institutions from which we or our collaborators obtain patient information; are subject to privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; or HIPAA. Although we are not directly regulated by HIPAA; we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a health care provider or research institution that has not satisfied HIPPA s disclosure standards. In addition; certain state privacy laws may apply directly to our operations and or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our use and dissemination of individuals health information. Moreover; patients about whom we or our collaborators obtain information; as well as the providers who share this information with us; may have contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations; even if we are not found liable; could be expensive and time consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
