We may not receive any further milestone; royalty or license payments under our current collaborations. Although we have received license fees and other payments to date under our current drug development collaborations with Kyowa Hakko Kirin and Daiichi Sankyo; we may not receive any royalty payments or additional license and milestone fees under such agreements. Our receipt of any future 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS milestone; royalty or license payments depends on many factors; including whether our collaborators want or are able to continue to pursue potential drug candidates; intellectual property issues; unforeseen complications in the development or commercialization process; and the ultimate commercial success of the drugs. Our cumulative share of the Daiichi Sankyo Phase 3 costs through December 31; 2015 totaled $101.4 million. We received a milestone of $25 million in February 2011 upon enrolling the first patient in the MARQUEE trial; the cash proceeds of which were subsequently applied to our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs. On January 31; 2013; we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 METIV trial of tivantinib; entitling us to a $15 million milestone. That $15 million milestone was also netted against our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs in 2013; and consequently we did not receive any cash proceeds from this milestone. Our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through December 31; 2015 by $61.4 million; which will be netted against future milestones and royalties; if any.
