We have federal and state net operating losses ( NOL ) and research and development credit carryforwards which; if we were to become profitable; could be used to offset defer federal and state income taxes. Such carryforwards may not; under certain circumstances related to changes in ownership of our stock; be available to us. As of December 31; 2015; we had federal NOL; state NOL; and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $357 million; $177 million and $28 million respectively; and expire at various dates through 2035. Such carryforwards could potentially be used to offset certain future federal and state income tax liabilities. Utilization of carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; as amended; as well as similar state provisions due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. In general; an ownership change; as defined by Section 382; results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three year period. We undertook a detailed study of our NOL and research and development credit carryforwards through January 31; 2016 to determine whether such amounts are likely to be limited by Sections 382 or 383. As a result of this analysis; we currently do not believe any Section 382 or 383 limitations will significantly impact our ability to offset income with available NOL and research and development credit carryforwards. However; future ownership changes under Section 382 may limit our ability to fully utilize these tax benefits. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the carryforwards before utilization. If we were not able to utilize our carryforwards; we would be required to use our cash resources to pay taxes that would otherwise have been offset; thereby reducing our liquidity.
