We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur significant continued losses for the next several years; and our future profitability is uncertain. From our inception in 1993 through December 31; 2015 we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately $482 million. These losses have resulted principally from the costs of our research activities; acquisitions; and enhancements to our technology and clinical trials. In the past we derived our revenue primarily from license and technology transfer fees and payments for compound deliveries associated with our discontinued chemistry services operations research and development funding paid under our agreements with collaboration partners and to a limited extent; milestone payments. We expect that our expenses will remain significant in order to fund research; development; clinical testing and commercialization of our drug candidates. We currently have a number of product candidates in various stages of clinical development. As a result; we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability. To attain profitability; we will need to develop clinical products successfully and market and sell them effectively; either by ourselves or with collaborators. We have never generated revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates; and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. Even if were to generate product revenues and achieve profitability; we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drugs; we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable; if at all. If we fail to become profitable; or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses; we may be unable to continue our business.
