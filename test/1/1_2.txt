We may need substantial additional funding and due to global capital and credit market conditions or for other reasons; we may be unable to raise capital when needed; or on terms favorable to us; which could force us to delay; reduce or eliminate our drug discovery; product development and commercialization activities. Volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets in recent years have led to a tightening of business credit and investment capital in the U.S. and internationally. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time; our efforts to raise capital will face additional difficulties. Developing drugs; conducting clinical trials; and commercializing products are expensive. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors; including the progress and cost of our ongoing and future collaborative and independent clinical trials and other research and development activities and our ability to share such costs of our clinical development efforts with third parties the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals the costs of filing; prosecuting; maintaining; defending and enforcing any patent applications; claims; patents and other intellectual property rights 25 TABLE OF CONTENTS the cost and timing of securing manufacturing capabilities for our clinical product candidates and commercial products; if any the costs and timing of commercializing our product candidates; including establishing or contracting for sales; marketing and distribution capabilities; if any such candidates receive regulatory approval for commercial sale and the costs of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses; products and technologies. We may seek the capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings; debt financings; or collaboration and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities; our stockholders ownership interests will be diluted and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. Other debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties; we may have to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently; or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us when required; on satisfactory terms; or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funds when needed; we may have to delay; reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our development and commercialization programs; or obtain funds through other arrangements on unattractive terms; which could prevent us from successfully executing our business strategy.
